This software is for use in taking a Rubix cube from unsolved to full or partial 
completion

This project was created as part of a 3rd year group project.
The software was developed solely by myself, Jonathan Molloy, on a short time frame.

The code is currently undergoing improvements, to improve both the commenting 
standards which were overlooked at the initial development stage due to time 
constraints and the algorithm itself.

To use, a Rubix cube is required to take photographs. Work is being undertaken
to improve the functionality of the "example" Rubix cube options so the code
can be displayed without a physical Rubix cube present.
